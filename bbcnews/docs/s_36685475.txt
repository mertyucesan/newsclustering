Dan Crowley has represented England at Under-19 level
League One side Oxford United have signed Arsenal midfielder Dan Crowley on a season-long loan deal.

The 18-year-old is yet to feature for the Gunners' first team but made 13 appearances during a loan spell at Barnsley last season, scoring once.

"Seeing how young players flourish under the manager Michael Appleton was a massive part in my decision," the teenager told BBC Radio Oxford.

"Last season was a learning curve and I can't wait to get started."

Crowley becomes Oxford's fifth signing of the summer following their promotion from League Two.

U's boss Appleton hopes to add two more permanent signings before their pre-season tour of Spain, which starts next weekend.
