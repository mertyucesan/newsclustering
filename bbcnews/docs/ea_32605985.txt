Martin Freeman has won a Bafta and an Emmy as Sherlock's Dr John Watson
Sherlock and The Hobbit star Martin Freeman has joined the cast of Marvel's Captain America: Civil War.
It is not yet known who he will play in the film - the third instalment of the superhero franchise - which is due for release in May 2016.
Marvel said they had been "consistently impressed" and were "honoured and excited to have such a talented actor join the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
Freeman won an Emmy Award and a Bafta for playing Dr John Watson in Sherlock.
Captain America: Civil War will pick up the story from the end of current blockbuster Avengers: Age of Ultron.
Superheroes from across the Marvel universe will be forced to side with either Captain America or Iron Man, played by Robert Downey Jr, as they do battle.


Both Freeman and his Sherlock co-star Benedict Cumberbatch have signed up to star in forthcoming Marvel films
Freeman, 43, whose breakthrough role came alongside Ricky Gervais in BBC comedy The Office, has more recently played Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit trilogy.
His performance as Fargo's small-town insurance salesman Lester Nygaard earned him Golden Globe and Emmy Award nominations.
"From his roles as Bilbo Baggins and Doctor Watson to Tim in The Office, Martin's range from the dramatic to the comedic has consistently impressed us," said Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige, who is also producing the latest Captain America film.
"We couldn't be more honoured or excited to have such a talented actor join the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
Sherlock co-star Benedict Cumberbatch is also joining Marvel to play complex lead Doctor Strange, which is scheduled for release in November 2016.
