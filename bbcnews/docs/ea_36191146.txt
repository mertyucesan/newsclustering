L to R: Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Kristen Wiig and Leslie Jones star in Paul Feig's film
The promo for the new Ghostbusters film has attracted more "dislikes" than any trailer shown on the YouTube website.
At time of writing, the trailer for the comedy franchise "reboot" has more than 647,600 "dislikes", compared with about 220,800 "likes".
That puts it 18th in YouTube's list of most disliked videos - higher than any other item of non-music content.
The trailer's unusual ratio of views to dislikes suggests a concerted campaign to vote down the video.
According to the ScreenCrush website, "a certain subset of people on the internet... are teaming up to downvote it into oblivion."
Released in July, Ghostbusters sees Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig and others take on a franchise previously headlined by male leads.
Its director, Paul Feig, recently told The Guardian that disliking the film because it has female stars was "just a non-starter".
Justin Bieber's Baby video is currently unassailable at the top of the YouTube rundown with 6.05 million dislikes.
Its nearest competitor, the promo for Rebecca Black's much-mocked Friday single, has just 2.05 million dislikes.
