Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows comes two years after its predecessor
The latest Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film has topped the US box office on its opening weekend, taking $35.3m (Â£24.2m).
But the movie was not as successful as its predecessor, which took $65.6m (Â£45.4m) when it opened in August 2014.
Last week's number one, X-Men: Apocalypse, slipped to number two with earnings of $22.3m (Â£15.5m).
Me Before You, based on the best-selling novel by Jojo Moyes, debuted at number three despite mixed reviews.
The film sees Game of Thrones actress Emilia Clarke play a young woman who falls in love with a disabled banker played by Sam Claflin.
Alice Through the Looking Glass, starring Johnny Depp, fell to number four, grossing just under $10.7m (Â£7.4m) in its second weekend.
The Angry Birds Movie rounded off the top five, making $9.8m (Â£6.8m).

Shakira, Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman all voiced characters in Zootopia
Disney's Zootopia - released as Zootropolis in the UK - passed the $1bn (Â£693m) mark over the weekend, only the fourth animated movie in history to do so.
Frozen, Minions and Toy Story 3 are the only other animated films to have passed the milestone.
Only one other film in 2016 has crossed the billion-dollar mark - Marvel's Captain America: Civil War.
Idris Elba, Octavia Spencer, Shakira, Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman all voice characters in Zootopia, which is set in a city populated by animals.
