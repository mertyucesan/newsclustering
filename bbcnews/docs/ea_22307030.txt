Quinto first played Spock in JJ Abrams' 2009 Star Trek reboot
Star Trek's Zachary Quinto will make his Broadway debut in Tennessee William's The Glass Menagerie, when it transfers to New York in September.
Quinto, who reprises the role of Spock in the forthcoming Star Trek sequel Into Darkness, takes the leading role as the play's narrator, Tom.
He shares the stage with two-time Tony award-winner Cherry Jones, who plays his mother Amanda Wingfield.
The production originally opened at Cambridge's American Repertory Theatre.
Writing in The New York Times, critic Ben Brantley called Quinto's work "a benchmark performance".
Referring to his co-star Jones, he added: "she's both even more than you hoped for and not at all what you might have expected".
Autobiographical
The play centres on an ageing Southern belle who hopes her son can fulfil her dreams of finding the perfect "gentleman caller" for her shy and damaged daughter, Laura - here played by Celia Keenan-Bolger.
Williams's first successful play, it is widely considered to be an autobiographical account of the playwright's own upbringing.
Adapted from Williams' short story, Portrait of a Girl in Glass, it first premiered in Chicago in 1944.
It was previously revived on Broadway in 2005, with Christian Slater and Jessica Lange in the lead roles.
Quinto, who rose to fame in the TV series Heroes as Sylar, recently won acclaim for his off-Broadway performance in Angels in America.
Previews of The Glass Menagerie, directed by John Tiffany, will run from 5 September, with opening night set for 26 September. The play will run for 17 weeks.
