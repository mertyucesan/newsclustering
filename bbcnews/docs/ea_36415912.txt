Dan Aykroyd is an executive producer on the new film
Dan Aykroyd, who played Ray Stantz in the original Ghostbusters film, has praised the upcoming reboot.
Aykroyd is listed as an executive producer on the movie, which features a female-led cast including Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig.
He commended the "brilliant, genuine performances from the cast both female and male".
The actor made the comments after seeing a test screening of Paul Feig's new film.
"It has more laughs and more scares than the first two films, plus Bill Murray is in it!" Aykroyd wrote on Facebook.
The first trailer became the most disliked movie trailer in YouTube history when it was released in March.
A second trailer was released last week on social media, which was more warmly received.
Referring to the character he played in the 1984 original, Aykroyd said: "As one of millions of man-fans and Ray Stantz, I'm paying to see that and bringing all my friends."

Almost all surviving members of the original Ghostbusters cast are set to make appearances in the reboot, including Aykroyd.
Rick Moranis declined an offer to be in the film.
Murray, Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson played the original ghost-busting quartet.
Directed by Ivan Reitman, the film made almost $300m (Â£198m) at the global box office. A sequel, Ghostbusters II, followed five years later.
McCarthy and Wiig are joined by Saturday Night Live comediennes Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon in the reboot.
Ghostbusters is released in the US on 15 July, and will be screened in the UK soon after.
