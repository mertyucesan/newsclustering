Southampton and England defender Ryan Bertrand has signed a new five-year contract with the Premier League club.

Bertrand, 26, joined Saints from Chelsea for Â£10m in February 2015 following an initial loan spell.

The left-back has won nine caps for England, most recently against Slovakia in the group stage at Euro 2016.

Bertrand joins team-mates Virgil van Dijk, Fraser Forster, James Ward-Prowse and Steven Davis in agreeing a new deal with Southampton this summer.
