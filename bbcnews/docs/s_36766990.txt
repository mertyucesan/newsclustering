Sam Allardyce "would make a very good England manager", according to his former boss at West Ham, David Gold.

The Sunderland manager is favourite to succeed Roy Hodgson, who resigned after England's Euro 2016 exit.

It was reported this week that Allardyce, 61, would be interviewed for the role, but he is yet to be contacted by the Football Association.

"I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him," Hammers co-chairman Gold told BBC Radio 5 live.

"He is determined, he is ambitious. He's been in the business a long time.

"I think the most important thing from my point of view is that he's English."

Allardyce the 'master' of winning


Sam Allardyce helped Sunderland avoid relegation from the Premier League last season
Allardyce took charge at Sunderland in October and steered the club to Premier League safety.

The Black Cats finished 17th, one place and two points above the relegation zone, after losing only one of their final 11 league matches of the 2015-16 season.

Former Chelsea and England striker Chris Sutton said: "I think Allardyce has clout. He's proved himself. He gets the job done.

"If Euro 2016 has taught us anything, it's about learning how to win football matches and Sam Allardyce is the master.

"How he kept Sunderland up this season, I don't know, but it was an incredible achievement.

"He studies opposition's weaknesses, he knows his team's strengths and he plays to them. It's all about winning."

Second time lucky for Allardyce?

Allardyce left Sunderland's pre-season training camp in Austria on Monday and returned to England to conduct some transfer business.

The club said it was "business as usual".

He was interviewed for the England job in 2006 following the departure of Sven-Goran Eriksson, but the FA instead chose to appoint Steve McClaren, who had been the Swede's assistant.

Prior to joining Sunderland he spent four seasons as boss of West Ham, who he led back to the Premier League via the play-offs in 2012.

He has also managed Blackburn, Newcastle, Blackpool, Notts County and Bolton, who were promoted to the top flight and qualified for Europe during his tenure.

Could Klinsmann return to England?


Jurgen Klinsmann's contract to coach the USA runs until after their 2018 World Cup campaign
It is understood no official approach has been made to the US Soccer Federation about Jurgen Klinsmann.

It was claimed Klinsmann had discussions over the role, with the German thought to be in California.

The former striker, Klinsmann spent the 1994-95 season in the Premier League with Tottenham.

As a coach, the 51-year-old took Germany to the semi-finals of the 2006 World Cup, held on home soil.

An ill-fated stint in charge of Bayern Munich ended in April 2009 when he was sacked and replaced by Jupp Heynckes.

He took the USA job in 2011, won the Concacaf Gold Cup in 2013 and reached the last 16 of the 2014 World Cup, where they were beaten by Belgium in extra time.

USA were beaten by Jamaica in the semi-finals of last year's Gold Cup and reached the semi-finals of last month's Copa America Centenario, where they lost to Argentina.

Selecting a new England boss

Hodgson's successor will be chosen by a three-man panel of FA technical director Dan Ashworth, chief executive Martin Glenn and vice-chairman David Gill.

They have already spoken to former internationals - including Frank Lampard, Rio Ferdinand and Gary Lineker - as part of their review and have not ruled out an interim appointment, with World Cup 2018 qualifying beginning in September.

England Under-21s boss Gareth Southgate has already ruled himself out of the running.

Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe has been linked with the role.
