Jesus Gamez has experience of playing in the Champions League with Atletico
Championship side Newcastle United have signed full-back Jesus Gamez from Atletico Madrid on a two-year deal.

The 31-year-old, who plays predominantly on the right, was a regular in the Atleti matchday squad last season, playing 16 games.

He joined from Malaga in 2014 having made 289 appearances for the Malaguistas during a nine-season spell.

"It was the right time to leave Atletico Madrid and this is the right move for me," he said.

"We have an exciting project here, to bring Newcastle back to where it belongs, in the Premier League, and I am very happy to be a part of that."

Gamez is Rafa Benitez's fourth new signing this summer as Newcastle look to return to the Premier League.

Benitez said: "He is a very good defender who can play on both sides, left and right.

"He is experienced, I know he has great character and, importantly, he is an excellent professional. I am sure he will give balance to the team."

The Magpies have also confirmed that forward Yasin Ben El-Mhanni and defender Stuart Findlay, both 20, have joined their development squad.

El-Mhanni spent time on trial at Chelsea last season after mainly playing in non-league while Findlay joins after his release by Celtic this summer.
