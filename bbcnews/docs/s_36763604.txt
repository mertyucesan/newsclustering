Pogba failed to score in seven starts during his first spell at Manchester United
Paul Pogba's agent says there is no rush to sort out the future of the Juventus and France midfielder.

Manchester United are interested in the 23-year-old, though a deal for Pogba to return to Old Trafford is said to be "not out of the starting blocks".

Pogba is keen on the idea of joining Real Madrid, while Juve want him to sign a contract extension beyond 2019.

"Several big clubs are keen on his services and we have all the time to listen," said agent Mino Raiola.

"He has three years left at Juventus and they are asking him to renew. Why would they want to let him go?"

Pogba was part of the France team beaten in the final of Euro 2016 by Portugal.

He spent three years at Manchester United, but made just seven appearances before moving to Italy in 2012.

His agent has already played a major role in new United manager Jose Mourinho's summer recruitment as he also acts as representative for Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Henrikh Mkhitaryan.

Any deal for Pogba looks sure to be more complicated to negotiate, and is likely to cost United in excess of the world-record Â£85m Real paid Tottenham for Gareth Bale in 2013.

The transfer window will not close until 31 August but Mourinho has said he is not willing to wait that long to secure what he said was the fourth and final "fundamental" signing he wanted.

Raiola said Pogba is not desperate to move and he knows where the midfielder would like to spend next season, but added: "We didn't talk about transfers during the Euros."
