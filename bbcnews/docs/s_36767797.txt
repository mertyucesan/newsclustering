Hal Robson-Kanu scores to put Wales 2-1 up against Belgium
Hull manager Steve Bruce has said he wants to sign Wales' Euro 2016 hero Hal Robson-Kanu, but believes he will face competition for his signature.

Robson-Kanu, a free agent after leaving Reading, impressed in France.

His strike in the quarter-final win over Belgium was voted the goal of the tournament by BBC Sport viewers.

"We are booked in for talks with him and to see him in the next few days. Do we intend to offer him a deal? Yes," said Bruce.

Robson-Kanu's impressive displays at Euro 2016 have increased interest in a player who says he has offers "from around the world" looking to sign him for next season.

"I had offers before the tournament - good offers from good, progressive clubs - but I made a decision to wait," Robson-Kanu told BBC Sport.

"I've made no secret of my desire to play in the Premier League and if that's the best place for me then I'll be there.

"I am aware there has been a bit of a frenzy, so to speak."

Bruce, linked with the vacant England manager's role, revealed talks over Robson-Kanu are ongoing as he plots new additions following Hull's promotion back to the Premier League.

He would be keen to deploy Robson-Kanu in a role similar to how he performs for Wales.

"I think Hal is a good age, has had a sort of re-birth if you like, of playing through the middle, because before that he has played wide most of the time," Bruce explained to BBC Radio Humberside.

"He is big, strong, powerful, quick and somebody who runs the other way, in football terms.

"I know we have got competition, so let's see what we can do."
