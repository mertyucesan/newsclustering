Gareth Bale with his daughter Alba Bale on the pitch after Wales' win over Northern Ireland
The Football Association of Wales was warned by Uefa after Wales players brought their children on to the pitch to celebrate their wins at Euro 2016.

Players including Gareth Bale, Hal Robson-Kanu and Ashley Williams shared their victorious run to the last four with their families after Wales beat Northern Ireland and Belgium in France.

Wales were then asked by Uefa not to bring children on to the pitch after the semi-final due to safety concerns.

The FAW has declined to comment.

A Uefa spokesperson said: "The Uefa Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body has dealt with this case, and decided to issue a warning to the Football Association of Wales."

Pictures of Gareth Bale holding his daughter Alba on the pitch following Wales' win over Northern Ireland in the last 16 were splashed across conventional and social media, and his team-mates followed suit after Wales' victory over Belgium in the quarter-finals.

But before the 2-0 semi-final defeat by Portugal, which ended Wales' adventure, Uefa said: "It is a European Championship, not a family party."

Tournament director Martin Kallan added: "A stadium is not the most safe place for small kids if fans invaded the field, and with stadium staff operating machinery on the playing surface."
