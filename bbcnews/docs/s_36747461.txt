Petr Cech's final game for the Czech Republic was the 2-0 Euro 2016 defeat to Turkey
Arsenal goalkeeper Petr Cech has announced his retirement from international football with the Czech Republic.

The 34-year-old is his country's most capped player with 121 appearances, having made his debut in 2002.

He was part of the Czech side that reached the semi-final at Euro 2004, losing to eventual champions Greece.

"When I was a kid, my ultimate dream was to play for the national team at least once," he told Arsenal's website.

"Having done it so many times makes me really proud."
