Graziano Pelle scored 30 goals for Southampton
Southampton striker Graziano Pelle has joined Chinese Super League side Shandong Luneng for Â£12m.

Pelle, 30, joined the Premier League side from Feyenoord in 2014 and scored 30 goals in 81 appearances.

He made his Italy debut while playing for Southampton and was part of their Euro 2016 squad, scoring twice.

Pelle is the third player to leave the Saints this summer, after midfielder Victor Wanyama joined Tottenham and Liverpool signed forward Sadio Mane.

Former AZ Alkmaar and Parma forward Pelle joins ex-Newcastle striker Papiss Cisse at Shandong, who are managed by former Fulham boss Felix Magath.

Saints, meanwhile, have signed Bayern Munich midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg for a reported Â£12.8m.
