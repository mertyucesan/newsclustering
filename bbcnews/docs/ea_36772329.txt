Shooter stars Ryan Phillippe and Omar Epps
A US TV drama about a sniper has been postponed after the Dallas sniper attack.
Five police officers were killed on 8 July when a gunman opened fire at officers during a peaceful protest.
The Shooter, which stars Ryan Phillippe as an expert marksman, was due to start on 19 July.
Co-star EddieMcClintock tweeted that the show had been delayed until 26 July "as a show of respect, and to honour the fallen officers of Dallas, Texas".
The 10-part series is based on the best-selling novel Point of Impact, by Stephen Hunter, and the 2007 film starring Mark Wahlberg.
'Recent tragic events'
It follows an expert marksman living in exile who is coaxed back into action after learning of a plot to kill the president.
A spokesperson for the USA Network told the Hollywood Reporter: "In light of recent tragic events and out of respect for the victims, their families and our viewers, we have decided to postpone the premiere date for the upcoming USA Network series Shooter to July 26."
Phillippe, who is also a producer of the show, plays Bob Lee Swagger, an expert marksman, who is persuaded to return to work for a clandestine operation by his former commanding officer played by Omar Epps.
Wahlberg is an executive producer on the show.
When the series was announced Jackie de Crinis, Executive Vice President of Original Programming at the USA Network said the show was "an uncompromising exploration of the definition and evolution of a hero."
