Shaun Donnellan joins a Stevenage side that finished 18th in League Two last season
West Bromwich Albion defender Shaun Donnellan has joined League Two side Stevenage on loan until January.

The 19-year-old has not played a first-team game for the Baggies since coming through their ranks, but has captained the Premier League side's Under-21s.

The Republic of Ireland Under-19 international spent some of last season playing for National League North side Worcester City alongside brother Leo.

He becomes Boro manager Darren Sarll's fifth signing of the summer.

Donnellan follows left-back Andrew Fox and forwards Jake Hyde, Matt Godden and Rowan Liburd through the door at the Lamex Stadium.
