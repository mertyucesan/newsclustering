Vardy is one of five strikers in England's Euro 2016 squad
Jamie Vardy is keeping Arsenal and Leicester City waiting as he continues to ponder his club future.

The England striker, 29, was due to choose whether to remain with the Foxes or join the Gunners before flying out to France for Euro 2016 on Monday.

But he arrived with the rest of the England squad without informing Arsenal of his decision.

Arsenal will wait for a decision on a reported Â£120,000-a-week offer before the tournament starts on 10 June.

Arsenal, who finished second behind Premier League champions Leicester, are believed to have offered in the region of Â£20m for Vardy to trigger the release clause in his contract.

The former Fleetwood Town forward only signed a new three-year contract, reported to be worth Â£60,000-a-week, with Leicester in February.

Vardy joined Leicester from Fleetwood for Â£1m in 2012 and helped the Foxes to the Premier League title last season, scoring 24 goals.
