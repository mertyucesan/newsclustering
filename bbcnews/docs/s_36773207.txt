Everton are to rename two of Goodison Park's stands in honour of club icons Howard Kendall and Sir Philip Carter.

The Gwladys Street End will be renamed the Howard Kendall Gwladys Street End and the Park Stand will be renamed the Sir Philip Carter Park Stand.

Everton Chairman Bill Kenwright described the pair as "two of the greatest Evertonians of all time".

Kendall, Everton's most successful manager, died in October 2015, while ex-chairman Carter died in April 2015.
