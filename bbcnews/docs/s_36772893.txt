Carlos Bacca has been prolific at Milan as well as previous clubs Sevilla and Bruges
West Ham are in negotiations with AC Milan over the transfer of Colombia striker Carlos Bacca.

The 29-year-old, reported to be worth Â£26m, joined Milan from Sevilla for Â£21m last summer and scored 21 goals in his first season with the Italian side.

He scored twice as Colombia got to this summer's Copa America semi-finals.

The Hammers have already brought Sofiane Feghouli, Havard Nordtveit, Toni Martinez and, most recently, Gokhan Tore to the club this summer.

German-born Turkey winger Tore signed from Besiktas on Monday on a one-year loan deal that could become a permanent transfer.
